CSS:

(Styled it a bit differently, with gradient as a background and slightly rounded hands; made hour hand smaller; used default root element font-size (16px) and adjusted ```rem``` sizes accordingly;

Rotate - default: transform-origin: 50%; to make hands rotate around the right end point apply transform-origin:100% (x-axis)

JS:

-We needed the function to run every second: setInterval (/function name/, /ms/)

-Using ```Date()``` object to read the current time (with ```.getSeconds()```;```.getMinutes()```; and ```.getHours()```)

- Making hour hand shorter, instead of using CSS, added ```scale(0.75, 1)``` to JS style transform
